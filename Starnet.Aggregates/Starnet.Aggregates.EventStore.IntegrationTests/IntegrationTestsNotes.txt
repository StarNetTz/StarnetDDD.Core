Run event store in docker with default settings, for integration tests purposes.
1. Install docker, linux mode
2. Pull docker image:	docker pull eventstore/eventstore
3. Run container using:	docker run --name eventstore-node -it -p 2113:2113 -p 1113:1113 eventstore/eventstore
4. Activate/deactivate ncrunch on ES projects to check tests and coverage
5. Pay attention to docker image db contents, as it will only grow with time. Purge it from time to time.
